            This site was created to help people that have thousands of rands in debt with zero savings and even less hope in finding better ways to solve their money issues. Most people don’t know how to budget or what a budget plan is so they tend to overspend on some items or even lose track of what they spend their money on. Here at Quantum Force we looked at what people spend their money on, we then analyzed the findings to help decide what necessary steps needed to be set in place to help individuals create budget plans that will cater for all their needs.
            Quantum Force is a simple easy to use site that is free and will allow individuals to register on the site and add their own budgeting plans to their account. These plans will be showed in more detail with the help of out transactions page that will indicate to the individual how much money has been spent in the budget they have set out. This money spent will also be indicated with percentages and will notify the user when he/ she tries to over spend on their budgets. There are also other features that will help display the individual’s details with the help of calendars and graphs.
            Hundreds of thousands of people have signed up to use Quantum Force to help solve their financial needs and we hope you would do the same. To show you our commitment to the site here are some of our top priorities we all share at Quantum Force to help provide quality software to our users:
