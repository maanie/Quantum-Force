                    <b>Make Saving a Priority</b>
                    <div>
                        Your goal should be to save at least 10% of your pre-tax earnings. Consider paying yourself first by starting a regular savings plan that could form the backbone of a fund from which you will be able to draw money to cover the necessities of life.
                        Whether you are saving for a major purchase or for your retirement, you will never reach your goals unless you make savings a priority. Little changes can add up to big savings on expenses. Those savings can be put to good use for achieving your long term savings goals.
                        Are you a spender or a saver? Be honest with yourself and select investments that will provide you with the discipline you may need.

                   <div>
                       Turn savings into a game. Instead of force feeding budgeting tips to yourself, look at this as an adventure. Try to top your own savings each month or compete with a friend. Make savings a family affair – have a fun programme of savings for everyone to enjoy.
                       Consider having a kitchen jar to save money for a family holiday. You might want to give yourself pocket money allowance. The key is that your spending should not exceed your allowance. After the money is gone, its gone.

Even by just tracking where the money is going, you will be more aware of your spending habits and eliminate unnecessary spending. One of the best ways to save money is to never see it.
